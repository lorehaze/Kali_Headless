I would recommend using x11vnc as it provides the actual desktop experience rather than a virtual one.

To install x11vnc enter the following command:

apt-get update && apt-get install -y x11vnc

If you experience that the framebuffer size is too small, then to change it by doing the following:

Locate /boot/config.txt and open it using nano or vim
(Note: If the file /boot/config.txt does not exist, safely power-off the Pi using the command, poweroff and take the Micro-SD card out and plug it into a laptop or desktop computer. When the Micro-SD card mounts, open it. The config.txt file should be on the root of the mounted Micro-SD card).

uncomment the following text in config.txt:
Before:

#framebuffer_width=1280

#framebuffer_height=720

After:

framebuffer_width=1280

framebuffer_height=720

Save and exit the file. Then, reboot the Pi and start x11vnc
